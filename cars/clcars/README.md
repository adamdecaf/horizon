# clcars

A program that listens on Craigslist for cars

### Notes

- PhantomJs (or just http client) to emulate browser
  - required `reqdiff` service I've been thinking of
- Copy in a few Charles sessions to mimic flow.
  - Semi random selection
    - Timing characteristics
    - Similar models of cars (but not too much)
    - Price Ranges
